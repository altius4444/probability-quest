My tests to find out whether it is better to guess questions whose answers you don't know, the marking scheme being: <br>
+4 marks for correct answer <br>
-1 mark for wrong answer <br>
0 marks for skipped questions <br>
<p>
<b> Final Result: </b> <br>
68.36% chance of gaining marks <br>
31.64% chance of losing marks <br>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Some interesting observations: <br>
<ul> The chance for gaining marks decreased to ~66% when the number of questions attempted is one more than a multiple of 4 </ul>
<ul> The chance for gaining marks increased to ~71.8% when the number of questions attempted is two more than a multiple of 4 </ul>
<ul> The chance for gaining marks decreased to ~53.9%, the chance for no net marks became 22.5% and 
  the chance for losing marks decreased to 23.5% when the number of questions attempted is three more than a multiple of 4 </ul>
<ul> The final result above only applies when number of questions attempted is a multiple of 4 </ul>
</p>
